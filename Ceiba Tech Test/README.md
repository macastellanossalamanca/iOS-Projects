## CEIBA Tech Test 

- This test displays a list of users and their posts, obtained from an API using URLSession. The data is stored using CoreData. The architechture used in this project is MVVM and Delegate Pattern. This project also abstracts Data Manage, therefore we can find a DataManager which fullfills Repository Pattern requirements. Besides, its interface is implemented using SwiftUI, which ensures a reactive response.

# How it works

- Just below you can find a video of the project running.
